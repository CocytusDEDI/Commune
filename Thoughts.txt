Magic system:
- max power (energy / second) output (increases with level up)
    - changes around 100%
        - goes up if in fury immediately (rename)
        - goes down if in calm immediately (rename)
- focus (doesn't change with level up)
    - factors into amount of control available (via multiplication by focus)
    - facotrs into amount of max power (via multiplication by focus)
    - changes around 1:
        - goes up when in calm by amount per second (rename)
        - goes down when in fury by amount per second (rename)
        - goes down while casting spells
        - goes up while doing nothing
    - expentionially hard to reach both zero focus and 2 focus
        - use sigmoid function `F = 2/(1+e^-x)` where `x = x + change_in_focus * delta` where delta is time between frames
- control (increases with level up)
    - is an amount available
    - goes down with use of control
    - goes back up when not using that control
    - overall total control changes around 100% via multiplication by focus
